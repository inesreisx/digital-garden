        <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
        <p>"When I grow up, I want to wear a gabardine and support myself." As a child, my idea of success was simple: independence and a stylish gabardine. Decades later, I've achieved independence, but I've realized that gabardines aren't quite my style.</p>
        <p>I come from a low/middle-class family. My mother was the first in our family to earn a university degree. My grandfather worked in the merchant marine, and my grandmother held multiple jobs even after retirement. Hard work and dreams have always been part of our lives.</p>
        <p>At age 9, I started selling small handmade clay decorations and scoobie strings to my friends at school and church. Earning 18 euros was my biggest achievement at the time, and I was overjoyed.</p>
        <p><em>"If you can dream it, you can do it."</em></p>
        <p>Following my passion for online gaming communities, I got into Content through SEO and research. Finding gaps for Content development is the core that drives me forward, be it at tech or writing. I find happiness in improving processes and building opportunities for growth.</p>

                <strong>Lessons I have learned at work</strong>
                <p>Never assume, always ask</p>
                <p>Make sure to understand your contract, know exactly what your duties and rights are</p>
                <p>DO NOT WORK WITHOUT A CONTRACT. Because in the end if it’s not written, it does not exist and no one will care about it besides yourself</p>
                <p>Be kind to people. Everyone has their own story and is going through something</p>
                <p>Be honest and transparent. If you’re the best match for the role, just go for it, if you aren’t, don’t be afraid to say it, and go on looking for a new adventure</p>
                <p>Keep working and saving, to have money for at least the next 6 months in case you become unemployed - bills won’t magically disappear</p>
                <p>Avoid stagnation. Life’s too short, thrive for a new learning every day</p>
                <p>Don’t be afraid to fail or make mistakes - it’s the best way to learn</p>
                <p>Something a manager once said: Learn from others’ mistakes - so you can avoid them for yourself</p>
                <p>Stick to your values as long as you can, prove them wrong</p>
                <p>There’s no perfect job - learn to look at the bright side</p>
                <p>Don’t get yourself involved with drama, nor talk behind someone’s back - if your co-workers are doing this, they’re also doing it with you. Aka a red flag</p>
                <p>Don’t overwork yourself and enjoy your breaks - I’m still working on this. As someone once said to me: “You’re working hard, don’t overwork yourself, take a break, you’ll still get your dollars at the end of the day”</p>
                <p>Be grateful to be working! Someone out there right now is wishing to be in your shoes</p>
