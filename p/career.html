  <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p>"When I grow up I want to wear a gabardine and be able to support myself." When younger, independency and wearing a gabardine was my definition of what a successful person was in what it seemed to be still a far far away future. Time flew by and decades later, I've become independent, but I should tell my younger self, I ended up not enjoying gabardines as much.</p>
  
          <p>I come from a low/middle class family. My mother was the first in the family to obtain an university degree, my grandfather worked in the merchant marine, and my grandmother still had more than one job after she retired. Hard work and dreams have always been present throughout life. My sister has also worked throughout her bachelor and master studies.</p>

<p>At age 9, I started selling small handmade clay decorations and scoobies strings to my friends at school and at church. 18 euros was my biggest gain! And I remember being extremely happy.</p>


          <p><i>"If you can dream it, you can do it".</i></p>
  <p>For the years to follow after the 2008 crisis, finances became tighter. When the time to apply for uni arrived, I didn't know exactly what to do nor who ‚ÄúI wanted to be‚Äù. I tried Management and Accounting but didn‚Äôt enjoyed nor performed well. Alongside, job search in Portugal for someone without qualifications was (and unfortunately still is) tough.</p>
  
          <p>In 2016, I got the opportunity to moved to the UK, and enrolled in Marketing Management under a student finance loan.
          </p>

<p>In August 2017 at age 20, I started working as a Kitchen Porter at different venues, and as a Student Ambassador at uni in Manchester, UK. Although the dishwasher roles were tough and I didn‚Äôt have holidays nor weekends for almost two years, I loved both of these experiences, mainly because I met a lot of hardworking people from many different backgrounds, and learned many lessons.
  
          </p>

<p>By December 2019, I had finished uni, left the kitchens, and got my first Junior role in SEO at an eCommerce agency in Bolton, UK. I was then laid off in March 2020 during the pandemic.
  
          </p>

<p>I went back to Portugal and spent a couple of months applying for jobs. I also had my first experience as a freelancer link-builder working from my laptop. And I got this domain!

  
          </p>
<p>By June 2020, I got a job as a Junior SEO Specialist and moved countries again, now to Amsterdam, The Netherlands. After one year there and reflecting back on my previous different experiences, I realized this: ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs too short to not follow your dreams‚Äù
After two years and even being promoted to Content Marketing Specialist, I quit in April 2022 and went on to look for something different. I quickly got a role as a Junior SEO Content Manager in May, but it wasn‚Äôt a match and left in July.
          </p>


<p>By August, I decided to let myself relax to re-orientate my life, my goals, to cultivate myself more, to be with my family. I hadn‚Äôt been to the beach for the past two years, nor really had a summer holiday since 2017.
          </p>
<h2>It‚Äôs ok not to have one true calling</h2>
<p>One of the best email feedbacks I‚Äôve ever received from a job application, came from the US: ‚ÄúFocus on making sure that you get your narrative crystal clear.‚Äù
  
          </p>

<p>I have dreamed of being a doctor, a scientist, an architect, a writer, a journalist, or just a woman working in an office doing any office work. Although I enjoy learning about Sciences and Arts in my spare time, these areas never sparked anything professionally-driven in me. I remember coming across a leaflet on a 12th grade job fair about Product Design and keep reading about it. I still remember it because it makes sense for me now. For more than 20 years I have been ‚Äúforcing‚Äù myself to get on the ‚Äúright path‚Äù because I like to learn and do a bit of everything. But, is there really a ‚Äúright path‚Äù? Nope. 
  
          </p>

<p>When I came across the term ‚Äúmultipotentialite‚Äù it just hit me. I don‚Äôt have nor feel (until now at least) to have one true calling, and that‚Äôs totally fine.
  
          </p>

<p>Yet, I did notice a pattern across all my journey and projects and works so far: I truly love to create. Create to solve problems. Create for people. Create to get feedback. Create to make whatever it is, to come to life and grow. Create great things together with great people!

  
          </p>
<h2>YOLO, do what makes you happy</h2>
          <p>Super clich√™ but true. You‚Äôre not coming back to this life ever again (maybe in another form for the believers like me), so why not trying to live your best life and doing what makes you happy? ‚ÄúThat only happens to others‚Äù, ‚ÄúI keep trying but nothing happens‚Äù are total excuses (what are the others doing that you aren‚Äôt? Are you truly trying or just saying you are?). And as my mother says: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare saying <i>I can‚Äôt</i>‚Äù. Saying that, immediately builds a mental barrier.</p>
<p>If there‚Äôs one quote I could reference it as my favorite, it is: <i>‚ÄúIf you can dream it, you can do it‚Äù.</i></p>
